# Summarizer and PDF Jarvis using OpenAI
The App has two pages and features:

Create a Singlestore account and create the following table:

    CREATE TABLE `multiple_pdf_example` (
      `id` bigint(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      `text` text CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci,
      `embeddings` blob,
      UNIQUE KEY `PRIMARY` (`id`) USING HASH,
      SHARD KEY `__SHARDKEY` (`id`),
      SORT KEY `__UNORDERED` ()
    ) AUTOSTATS_CARDINALITY_MODE=INCREMENTAL AUTOSTATS_HISTOGRAM_MODE=CREATE AUTOSTATS_SAMPLING=ON SQL_MODE='STRICT_ALL_TABLES'


**Home page** - A simple example of a Python app that takes a URL, scrapes the data and then sends to Open AI to summarize.
If the scraped data is too long, it will be split into multiple requests to Open AI.

**PDF Jarvis** - An app that reads the uploaded PDF, converts them to embeddings, loads them into a SingleStore database. When the user asks a question, the app does a semantic match against the emebeddings in SingleStore and then sends that as a context to OpenAI to print back the answer.


To run the app locally,
Create a venv with Python 3.9.16

copy .env.sample to .env

update .env file with appropriate information

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

```streamlit run main.py```
